This repo contains the iPython process book and associated data used for our final project in Harvard's CS109: Data Science.

**WARNING: The notebook contained in this repository is LARGE. It takes some time to open. Chrome may give you the option of closing what it thinks is an "unresponsive page" when you attempt to open the notebook, `executive-evolution.ipynb`. You may need to select "wait" several times, but the notebook *WILL* open.**

**NOTE: Our GitHub repository contains the raw data which we scraped or otherwise generated. See the [data directory](https://github.com/rlucioni/executive-evolution/tree/master/data) on GitHub. Due to limitations on the size of a file which can be uploaded to an iSite dropbox, we have not submitted the data directory alongside this notebook. The code required to regenerate every data file is included in this notebook, but takes considerable time to run. As such, we *STRONGLY RECOMMEND* that you download the data directory from our GitHub repository. Once downloaded, the data directory should be placed in the same directory as this notebook.**

The presidency today is not what it was when George Washington took office. It has changed continuously over time, and several facets of the office have only emerged in modern times. As such, time is a key factor to take into consideration when attempting to compare the many presidents of the United States. However, despite changing times, there are presidents from all periods of American history who are commonly considered “great” presidents. In this project, we study the evolution of the executive office over time and attempt to quantitatively explain the success of “great” presidents such as Washington, Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt - presidents who faced unique challenges and lived in starkly different times.
