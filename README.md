The presidency today is not what it was when George Washington took office. It has changed continuously over time, and several facets of the office have only emerged in modern times. As such, time is a key factor to take into consideration when attempting to compare the many presidents of the United States. However, despite changing times, there are presidents from all periods of American history who are commonly regarded to be "great" presidents. In this project, we will study the evolution of the executive office over time and attempt to objectively explain the success of "great" presidents such as Washington, Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt - presidents who faced unique challenges and lived in starkly different times.
